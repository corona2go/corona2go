# Corona2go
Help build Corona2go, a public, open source mobile phone app that can track cases of contagious people and potentially hazardous contacts, and grant free movement to non-contagious people with respect to data protection and privacy.

## FOREWORD
Lifting the lockdown that has been imposed by authorities around the world on the population in order to prevent the coronavirus from spreading will entail serius challenges.

To keep the disease from resurfacing, ideally, people with acquired immunity should be free from restrictions of movement, while the rest of the population should remain in lockdown. That is, at this moment, impossible to achieve, for various reasons (lack of tests, reliability, organizational challenges, etc.).

Some governments are considering the possibility of lifting the restrictions by area (in some regions) or by age (younger people first).

But the more people you have in the streets and public places, the harder it will be to control who is free to move or not.

The only way to effectively control that it by having a "Dynamic Mobile Pass" with a QR code that:
- Grants the user access to the public space
- Keeps track of close contacts with other mobile phones for a certain duration (e.g. 21 days)
- Alerts mobile phone owner when contact is made with a contagious person
thus limiting re-spreading of the virus.

Some countries have already created mobile apps that store contact history (e.g. South Korea, Singapore), and others are launching mobile phone apps that allow people to bypass the lockdown and go outside their homes (e.g. France) in some conditions.

Those applications are highly data sensitive and may lead to massive government surveillance, with other undisclosed purposes in mind.

Also, those apps are focused on a single country. Instead, they should be deployed simultaneously in several countries; especially those who share open borders (e.g. Europe).
As the situation becomes more dramatic, countries are giving up on international solidarity (e.g. the facial masks war).
That means each country is trying to come up with its own solution to manage the fight against the borderless coronavirus, a strategy that is doomed to diminish the global fight against the borderless virus. 

Moreover, some countries may lack the resources or the expertise to come up with a viable strategy and may benefit from such free open source applications.

Open Source software and policies are the best answer to those problems, as everyone may see the source codes and specifications of the mobile app he is going to download to its smartphone, knowing exactly which data are stored and exchanged. It is time for Governments to embrace it.

**The Open Source community has a unique opportunity to massively help the world in its fight against deadly viruses !**
